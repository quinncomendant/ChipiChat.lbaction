        const response = LaunchBar.alert('ChipiChat: LaunchBar🥂ChatGPT', `Interact with ChatGPT and receive responses as LaunchBar items. Conversation history is preserved for context (up to ${config.get('max_history_tokens')} tokens and ${config.get('max_history_minutes')} minutes). Responses are cached on disk for ${config.get('cache_expiration_minutes')} minutes.

Send a message, question, or instruction to Chat GPT and quickly obtain and manipulate responses, LaunchBar-style:

✨  ⌘ (command, held when running the action)  Automatically open the response in your text editor.
✨  ⇧ (shift, held when running the action)  Automatically insert the response at the current cursor position.
✨  ⌃ (control, held when running the action)  Automatically Quick Look the response.
✨  ⌘C  Copy the response to the clipboard.
✨  ⌘Y  Quick Look the response.
✨  ↵ (return)  Open the response in your text editor (reconfigurable using the 'default_action' config option).
✨  → (right-arrow)  Browse the response as a list (ideal for acting on specific lines of text).
✨  ⇥ (tab)  Send the text to other LaunchBar targets, e.g., send the output to a friend by passing it to the Compose Message action.

Prefix your message with one-or-more modifiers for enhanced functionality:

🏷️  N.N: Set temperature to adjust response randomness, e.g., “1.5 why is the sky blue?”.
🏷️  4: Use the GPT-4 model (requires GPT-4 API access).
🏷️  code: Use the coder persona for code-only responses.
🏷️  copy: Automatically copy the response to the clipboard.
🏷️  list: Request response formatted as a bulleted list.
🏷️  new: Start a new conversation with no history.
🏷️  write: Use the copywriter persona, adhering to Orwell’s six rules for writers.

You can combine modifiers, e.g., “code copy 4 js function to get a uuid” sends “js function to get a uuid” to GPT-4 API with the code persona and copies the response. All modifiers must go before your message.

Manage history and settings with special commands:

⚡️ clear: Remove chat history without sending a message.
⚡️ config: Show current configuration settings.
⚡️ configreset: Reset all configuration options to defaults.
⚡️ configset KEY VALUE: Set the configuration KEY to VALUE.
⚡️ export: Save conversation history to a file in ~/Downloads/.
⚡️ help: Display this help message.
⚡️ history: Display chat history.
⚡️ version: Display ChipiChat version and check if a new version is available.
