# ChipiChat: LaunchBarü•ÇChatGPT

Interact with [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) and receive responses directly in [LaunchBar](https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html "LaunchBar 6"). Conversation history is preserved for context. Responses are cached on disk.

## Usage

### Send a message, question, or instruction to Chat GPT and quickly obtain and manipulate responses, LaunchBar-style:

- `‚åò` *(command, held when running the action)* Automatically open the response in your text editor.
- `‚áß` *(shift, held when running the action)* Automatically insert the response at the current cursor position.
- `‚åÉ` *(control, held when running the action)* Automatically Quick Look the response.
-  `‚åòY` Quick Look the response.
-  `‚åòC` Copy the response to the clipboard.
-  `‚Üµ` *(return)* Open the response in your text editor (reconfigurable using the `default_action` config [option](#options)).
-  `‚Üí` *(right-arrow)* Browse the response as a list (ideal for acting on specific lines of text).
-  `‚á•` *(tab)* Send the text to other LaunchBar targets, e.g., send the output to a friend by passing it to the Compose Message action.

### Prefix your message with one-or-more modifiers for enhanced functionality:

-  `N.N`: Set temperature to adjust response randomness, e.g., ‚Äú1.5 why is the sky blue?‚Äù.
-  `4`: Use the GPT-4 model (requires GPT-4 API access).
-  `code`: Use the coder persona for code-only responses.
-  `copy`: Automatically copy the response to the clipboard.
-  `list`: Request response formatted as a bulleted list.
-  `new`: Start a new conversation with no history.
-  `write`: Use the copywriter persona, adhering to Orwell‚Äôs six rules for writers.

You can combine modifiers, e.g., ‚Äú`code copy 4 js function to get a uuid`‚Äù sends ‚Äú`js function to get a uuid`‚Äù to *GPT-4* API with the *code persona* and *copies the response*. All modifiers must go at the beginning of the message.

### Manage history and settings with special commands:

- `clear`: Remove chat history without sending a message.
- `config`: Show current configuration settings.
- `config reset`: Reset all configuration options to defaults.
- `config set OPTION VALUE`: Set the configuration OPTION to VALUE, e.g., `config set default_action alert`.
- `export`: Save conversation history to a file in `~/Downloads/`.
- `help`: Display this help message.
- `history`: Display recent chat history.
- `version`: Display ChipiChat version and check if a new version is available.

## Installation

### Get an OpenAI API key

Before you can use ChatGPT, you must get an OpenAI API key:

1. Create an [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/signup).
2. Add a credit card in [Account ‚Üí Billing ‚Üí Payment methods](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/payment-methods).
3. [Create a new secret API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

### Install ChipiChat

1. Download `ChipiChat.lbaction.zip` from [releases](https://github.com/quinncomendant/ChipiChat.lbaction/releases), unzip it, and double-click it to install (or copy the `ChipiChat.lbaction` file into `~/Library/Application Support/LaunchBar/Actions/`).
2. Run the following command in Terminal.app to allow this unsigned action to run (otherwise [macOS Gatekeeper](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/gatekeeper-and-runtime-protection-sec5599b66df/web) will [complain](https://send.strangecode.com/f/gatekeeper-warning.png)):
```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Library/Application\ Support/LaunchBar/Actions/ChipiChat.lbaction
```
3. Open LaunchBar and type `cc` to invoke ChipiChat. 
4. Hit the spacebar, type `config set api_key YOURAPIKEYHERE`, and hit enter to save your API key in LaunchBar:

![config set api_key yourkeyhere](docs/1-set-api-key.png)

(Alternatively, you can use `export OPENAI_API_KEY="‚Ä¶"` in your `~/.profile` or `~/.bash_profile` file.)

Now you‚Äôre ready to use ChipiChat!

### Usage example

Invoke ChipiChat again (type `cc`), hit the spacebar, then enter a message and hit enter:

![Example Message](docs/2-example-message.png)

After a couple seconds, you receive the response:

![Response](docs/3-response.png)

That‚Äôs a bit hard to read, but if you press the right-arrow key, you can view it as a list:

![Response As List](docs/4-response-as-list.png)

Or, you can view it in Quick Look (press the left-arrow key to go back, then press `‚åòY`):

![Response As Quick Look](docs/5-response-as-quicklook.png)

ChipiChat has many features and myriad customizable options. Practice all the commands listed in [usage](#usage) and adjust the [configuration options](#configuration) until ChipiChat becomes invisible in your workflow.

## Updating

1. Run the `version` command to check for new versions.
2. Download the new `ChipiChat.lbaction.zip` file from [releases](https://github.com/quinncomendant/ChipiChat.lbaction/releases), unzip it, and double-click it to install.
3. Read the change log on the release page, which may have special instructions such as a requirement to run `config reset` after updating.

## Configuration

The following options can be changed using the `config set OPTION VALUE` command. For example, to change the `system_message`:

```
config set system_message You are a helpful but sarcastic assistent.
````

To view currently-set values, send the `config` command.

To reset all configuration options to defaults, send the `config reset` command.

### Options

- `api_key`: Your OpenAI API key (default: empty).
- `cache_expiration_minutes`: How long before cached responses expire. This is useful to avoid loading a cached response for the same question in a different context, e.g., ‚Äúshow me how to do that‚Äù from the cache might contain an out-of-context response (default: `5`).
- `cache_min_words`: Minimum words in input text required before response is cached. Short phrases are less unique, and are more likely to load cached respones from a different context (default: `3`).
- `default_action`: The action to run when hitting enter *after* receiving a response. (options: `open`, `insert`, `quicklook`, `alert`, `copy`, `largetype`; default: `open`).
- `default_action_opens_automatically`: Set this to `true` to run the `default_action` automatically without having to hit enter after receiving a response. (options: `true`, `false`; default: `false`).
- `filename_extension`: The extension of cached files changes how they open in a text editor and Quick Look (options: `txt`, `md`, `markdown`; default: `txt`). If you have a Quick Look extension that supports Markdown (e.g., [Peek](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/peek-a-quick-look-extension/id1554235898?mt=12)), change this to `md` for syntax highlighting. üòé
- `max_history_minutes`: Maximum age of conversation history in requests (default: `480`).
- `max_history_tokens`: Maximum amount of conversation history in requests (default: `1000`).
- `max_response_tokens`: Maximum amount of [tokens](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat/create-max_tokens) to return in the response (default: `2000`).
- `max_user_message_tokens`: Maximum amount of tokens allowed in the input text (default: `1000`).
- `model`: Which OpenAI [model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview) to use (default: `gpt-3.5-turbo`).
- `system_message`: The [system message](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/introduction) sets the overall behavior of the assistant (default: `You are a helpful assistant to an expert audience. Be succinct. Limit prose. Never repeat the user message. Never apologize. Never say ‚ÄúAs an AI language model‚Äù.`).
- `temperature`: What sampling [temperature](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create#completions/create-temperature) to use, between `0.0` and `2.0` (default: `0.1`).
- `timeout`: How many seconds to wait for a response from the API (default: `30`; using GPT-4 adds timeout + 60 seconds).
- `user_message_addendum`: Supplemental instructions that are included with every user message, useful because `gpt-3.5-turbo` does not always pay attention to system messages (default: `Be succinct. Limit prose. Never repeat the user message.`).

### Default actions

Use the `default_action` and `default_action_opens_automatically` options to customize your preferred interface for receiving responses. 

- `open`: Open the response in the default text editor. Hide LaunchBar.
- `insert`: Paste the contents of the response into the cursor position. Hide LaunchBar.
- `quicklook`: Open the response in Quick Look. LaunchBar remains open, so you can easily close the Quick Look (`Esc` key) and do something else with the response.
- `alert`: Open the response in a LaunchBar alert. Hit ‚ÄúReply‚Äù to keep the conversation going (the cursor will return to the input field, ready to send the next message).
- `copy`: Copy the contents of the response. Hide LaunchBar.
- `largetype`: Open the response in a LaunchBar‚Äôs large type display. Only useful for short responses.

## Tips

If you use a Quick Look plugin that formats markdown with syntax highlighting (such as [Peek](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/peek-a-quick-look-extension/id1554235898?mt=12)), these settings will open every response in Quick Look:

```
config set filename_extension md
config set default_action quicklook
config set default_action_opens_automatically true
```

The best settings to carry on a conversation is to use the LaunchBar alert model dialog, with a Reply button:

```
config set default_action alert
config set default_action_opens_automatically true
```

The `open` and `insert` actions are best for generating content, such as generating blog posts or emails.

The `open` and `quicklook` actions are best for generating code. Also press the right-arrow on a response to view it as a list of items, then copy‚Äìpaste just the few lines that you need.

Remember, you can override the default action behavior by holding *command*, *shift*, or *control* when you hit return to *open*, *insert*, or *Quick Look* the response.

Press the right-arrow to view a response as a [list with icons](https://send.strangecode.com/f/chipichat-complex-response-as-list.png) representing parts of Markdown content 
(<img src="docs/icons/bug.svg" alt="üêû" class="icon-inline"> for code,
<img src="docs/icons/genderless.svg" alt="‚ö´Ô∏è" class="icon-inline"> for ordered list,
<img src="docs/icons/caret-right.svg" alt="‚ñ∂Ô∏è" class="icon-inline"> for unordered list,
and <img src="docs/icons/comment.svg" alt="üí¨" class="icon-inline"> for all other text).

## To do

- [ ] How to do garbage collection on the cache dir? `~/Library/Caches/at.obdev.LaunchBar/Actions/com.strangecode.LaunchBar.action.ChipiChat/`
- [ ] Persona management:
    - `persona NAME SYSTEM-MESSAGE` to create or update a persona.
    - `persona NAME` to set a persona as the default.
    - `NAME USER-MESSAGE` to send USER-MESSAGE to the API using the system message persona assigned to NAME.
    - `persona NAME SYSTEM-MESSAGE` to create or update a persona.
    - For example, to create a persona name `pierre` that will translate submitted text into French: `persona pierre Translate the following text into French.` To use this persona: `pierre seventeen baguettes please`.
